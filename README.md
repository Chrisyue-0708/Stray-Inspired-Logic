Stray-Inspired Logic: Cat Interaction & Movement Framework

Overview
Inspired by BlueTwelve Studio's Stray, this project is a conceptual logic framework developed to explore the core mechanics of feline movement and environmental interaction.
As a 15-year-old student at UTC Reading, I developed this to bridge the gap between my passion for the game's atmosphere and the underlying programming structures required for character controllers.
 Core Features (Logic Implemented)
Contextual Jump System: Logic for determining valid landing spots based on height and distance.
Interaction Proximity: A system to handle how a stray cat interacts with robots or environmental objects (Droids, Vending Machines).
State Management: Managing the transition between Idling, Exploring, and Stealth modes.
Technical Implementation
The project focuses on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). By defining the cat and the environment as distinct classes, the system allows for:
Modularity: Easy to add new interaction types (e.g., "Meow" to distract enemies).
Scalability: Logic that can be migrated to Unreal Engine's Blueprints or C++.
 Future Roadmap
Port the logic into Unreal Engine 5.
Implement a basic 3D prototype with a third-person camera.
Refine the "Meow" interaction with sound-wave radius logic.
 Contact & Inspiration
I am a huge fan of the world-building in Stray. This repository is a testament to my journey toward becoming a Technical Artist/Game Developer.
